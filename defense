'''
The goal of this is to give expected points for a defense in fantasy football. I will be doing this
by simulating various elements of a game and combining the probabilities to get a final result. 
Elements listed below:

Points - scrape line and over/under, run a poisson distribution, 
convert the poisson to expected points scored and the expected points scored to FF points

Yards - scrape yds/g from offense and yd/gm from defense, normalize for home team, run a poisson distribution
convert poisson to expected points scored and expected points scores to FF points

Sacks - scrape sacks/gm offense and defense, normalize for home team, run a poisson and convert to FF points

Fumbles - assume 1.2/game with only 50% being recovered and convert to points

Interceptions - based off of defenseive ints and QB int rate, run poisson and convert to FF points

D/ST touchdowns - ignore for now

TODO
-create scraper for 2022
-play with home/away adjustments for sacks/yards/turnovers/points
-play with adjustment for 2021 into 2021 (how much 2021 data do we use to model vs. 2022 data)
-model safeties
-model D/ST TDs

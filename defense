'''
The goal of this is to give expected points for a defense in fantasy football. I will be doing this
by simulating various elements of a game and combining the probabilities to get a final result. 
Elements listed below:

Points - scrape line and over/under, run a poisson distribution, 
convert the poisson to expected points scored and the expected points scored to FF points

Yards - scrape yds/g from offense and yd/gm from defense, normalize for home team, run a poisson distribution
convert poisson to expected points scored and expected points scores to FF points

Sacks - scrape sacks/gm offense and defense, normalize for home team, run a poisson and convert to FF points

Fumbles - assume 1/game and convert to points

Interceptions - based off of defenseive ints and QB int rate, run poisson and convert to FF points

D touchdowns - 

ST touchdowns - see ranks
